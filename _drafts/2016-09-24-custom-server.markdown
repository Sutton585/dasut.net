# today's events

Today we setup a custom digital ocean server. And I'm playing around editting stuff.

We hooked up this site via github and told the server to pull changes and rebuild the files with jekyll.

We'll tone down the timing when we're ready but right now we literally just add makrdown, add & commit, then watch the site update.
